After running soap server xml code is generated.
- generates a WSDL file (XML definition of the service, operations, request/response types).
- serves SOAP requests/responses as XML over HTTP.
- we don’t see raw XML in the Python code because Spyne abstracts it into Python functions and data models. But the server exposes XML.
